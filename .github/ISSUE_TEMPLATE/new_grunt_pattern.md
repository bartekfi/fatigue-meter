## The lazy pattern

What's the grunt/lazy prompt pattern you discovered?

```
Example: "yep", "do that", "sounds right"
```

## Why it's lazy

What makes this a low-effort prompt? Why does it signal fatigue?

## When you use it

Do you use this when you're:
- [ ] End of day fatigue
- [ ] Just woke up
- [ ] Deep in flow (too lazy to type full response)
- [ ] Don't care anymore
- [ ] Other: ___

## Example usage

Show a real example where you (or someone) used this pattern.

```
Previous prompt: "Should I add error handling?"
Your response: "yep"
```

## Scoring suggestion

Should this be:
- [ ] -10 (minor grunt)
- [ ] -20 (classic grunt)
- [ ] -30 (peak laziness)
- [ ] Other: ___

**Fun fact**: Sharing your grunts helps everyone understand their fatigue patterns better. You're doing science!
